# DSpace 7 Example Lando Dev Environment

## Description

This is a rough, but ultimately _working_ example of a Lando dev environment for DSpace 7.
It's a good starting point, but might need further tweaking to get just right.

## How to use:

You'll need to clone the [DSpace 7 API project](https://github.com/DSpace/dspace/), as well as the [DSpace-Angular front-end](https://github.com/DSpace/dspace-angular/), 
into this folder. Ideally, you want to make your own fork of both of these projects before you clone them. 
That's up to you. The examples below will use the parent GitHub repositories for both of these projects. 
I don't recommend actually doing this, but it's good enough for this README.

```
git clone https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace.git
git clone https://github.com/DSpace/dspace-angular.git
```
