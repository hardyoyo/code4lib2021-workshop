# Exercise 4: Live Coding!
### Let's build a dev environment together!

### Winner of the poll: [Hyrax/Samvera](https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/blob/master/documentation/developing-your-hyrax-based-app.md)

1. Decide on what we're building
2. figure out what it needs
3. Cheat if we can: [Awesome Compose](https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose) or [UCLA's Californica Docker-Compose file](https://github.com/UCLALibrary/californica/blob/main/docker-compose.yml)
3. starting up Lando
```
cd exercise4
# write some yml
# check in with progress as we add each thing
# declare victory
```
### extra credit
 * identify and configure additional build steps (anything we manually type into tooling to get started)
 * are we using all the services we configured? is there anything we can throw out?
